# Guess the Number Game

A simple Guess the Number game implemented in TypeScript and React.

## Description

Guess the Number is a classic game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number and win the game.

This implementation uses TypeScript for type checking and React for building the user interface.

## Features

- Generates a random number between 1 and 100 for the player to guess.
- Provides feedback on each guess (too high, too low, or correct).
- Limits the number of attempts for the player to guess correctly.
- Displays the game outcome (win or lose).
- Allows the player to start a new game.
